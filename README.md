save-state
==========

Text adventure game with git version control of state as a central mechanic


Settings
========

To make the git analogy work, the setting should be computer based

Here are some options

Cyberpunk

Stimhacking, rigs, body art and piercings, oppressive governments, hacker culture. You would play a hacker, both in and out of cyberspace. Cool opportunities for customising your character, exploring meatspace relationships, and using git as a central mechanic during the hacking 'puzzles'

Matrix

There is no real world and we all live in a planet-wide computer simulation. You are enlightened by your genius, drug use, a secret techo-cabal or maybe all three. Suddenly, you can code reality, which gives yyou super powers, not least of which is git. You are under-equiped to fight the AI's that control the Matrix, so will die often  and need to use git extensively to survive.

Something historical?

I'd be excited to explore some alt history stuff. 1890 cyber-steam-punk, WWII code breaking, or 80s state sponsored Cold War hacking
